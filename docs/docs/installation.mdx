# Installation & Setup


Conveyor CI is a Linux application and is distributed via three main channels:

- Docker Image
- Installation Script
- Debian Package

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Image" default>
    ```sh
    docker run -d --name conveyor-ci openug/conveyor:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="script" label="Installation Script">
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL conveyor.open.ug/install | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian Package">
    1. Add the Conveyor CI APT repository:

      ```sh
      echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.open.ug stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openug.list
      ```

    2. Update your package list and install Conveyor CI:

      ```sh
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install conveyor
      ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initial Setup

The Docker image comes pre-configured with sensible defaults. However, the other installation methods require some initial setup.

Once installed, run the following command to complete the setup:

```sh
conveyor init
```

This will generate a default configuration file at `/etc/conveyor/conveyor.yml`, TLS certificates, and create the necessary directories.

You can then start the Conveyor CI service with:

```sh
systemctl enable conveyor
systemctl start conveyor
```

or run it directly with:

```sh
conveyor up
```

## Using Client SDKs

Conveyor CI provides client SDKs you can use:
