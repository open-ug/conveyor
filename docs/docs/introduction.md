**Conveyor CI** is an open-source **lightweight engine for building distributed CI/CD systems with ease.**.

Instead of building your own CI/CD system from scratch, Conveyor CI gives you a modular toolkit, SDKs, APIs, and drivers that handle the hard parts: execution, events, scaling, observability, and more.

## Key features

- **Built-in Observability**: Metrics, tracing, and logging integrated out-of-the-box.
- **Declarative CI/CD Workflows**: Define pipelines using a flexible, extensible API.
- **Real-time Event System**: Event-driven architecture powers responsive, dynamic execution.
- **Effortless Horizontal Scaling**: Built-in runtime scales drivers across distributed systems with zero extra code.
- **Live Log Management**: Stream and store logs in real time from every running task.
