**Conveyor CI** is a lightweight headless, cloud-native CI/CD orchestration engine designed for platform developers to build CI/CD systems with minimal overhead.

Conveyor CI consists of an API Server that serves as the core component and provides you with SDKs and a Programming API to build upon.


## Why use Conveyor CI

Conveyor CI is ideal for teams and organizations that need a flexible, embeddable CI/CD engine to power custom platforms or workflows. 

It is ideal for use cases such as developing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) where organisations need to integrate CI/CD into their own developer platform with full control over pipelines and workflows, automating internal workflows that go beyond standard software pipelines, quickly prototyping new CI/CD workflows, edge self hosted or air gapped deployments etc.

To make this possible, Conveyor CI ships the following features:

- Declarative Pipelines and Workflows
- Custom Execution Logic
- Realtime Event Driven Architecture
- Lightweight Design
- API-first & SDK-ready
- Modern Distributed Architecture
