**Conveyor CI** is an open-source **lightweight engine for building distributed CI/CD systems with ease.**.

Instead of building your own CI/CD system from scratch, Conveyor CI gives you a modular toolkit, SDKs, APIs, and drivers that handle the hard parts: execution, events, scaling, observability, and more.

## Key features

- **Built-in Observability**: Metrics, tracing, and logging integrated out-of-the-box.
- **Authentication & Security**: TLS certificates and JWT token-based authentication for secure API access.
- **Lightweight & Modular**: Core engine with extensible driver architecture.
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time pipeline execution with comprehensive event streaming.
- **Scalable**: Distributed architecture designed for cloud-native environments.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Rich APIs, SDKs, and documentation for easy integration.
- **Declarative CI/CD Workflows**: Define pipelines using a flexible, extensible API.
- **Real-time Event System**: Event-driven architecture powers responsive, dynamic execution.
- **Effortless Horizontal Scaling**: Built-in runtime scales drivers across distributed systems with zero extra code.
- **Live Log Management**: Stream and store logs in real time from every running task.


## Installation

Conveyor CI is distributed as an OCI container and available on Docker Hub. It depends on `etcd`, `loki`, and `nats`, so a standard Docker Compose configuration is provided.

> **Helm charts coming soon**

To Install it on docker compose you can head over to the Releases page and download `compose.yml` and `loki.yml` or on a linux system you can download them using `curl`.

```sh
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/open-ug/conveyor/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep compose.yml | cut -d '"' -f 4 | xargs curl -L -o compose.yml

curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/open-ug/conveyor/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep loki.yml | cut -d '"' -f 4 | xargs curl -L -o loki.yml
```

Next start the containers using docker compose.

```sh
docker compose up

# OR

docker compose up -d
```

The Conveyor API Server will be reachable on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

**Note**: For production deployments, configure authentication using TLS certificates and JWT tokens. See the [Authentication Documentation](docs/authentication.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Authentication

Conveyor CI supports secure authentication using TLS certificates and JWT tokens. This ensures that only trusted clients can connect and interact with the API server.

**Key features**:
- TLS mutual authentication with client certificates
- JWT token-based authorization  
- Certificate Authority (CA) based trust model
- Configurable authentication levels (required, optional, or disabled)

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md).
