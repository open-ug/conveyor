# Conveyor CI

**Conveyor CI** is a lightweight headless, cloud-native CI/CD orchestration engine designed for platform developers to build CI/CD systems with minimal overhead

It provides a modular toolkit of **APIs, SDKs, drivers, and a Go-based runtime** so you can build your own CI/CD platform without reinventing execution, event handling, scaling, and observability.

## Installation

Conveyor CI is a Linux first application and can be installed by simply running this shell script.

```sh
curl -fsSL conveyor.open.ug/install | sh
```

For other installation options please checkout the [Installation and Setup](https://conveyor.open.ug/docs/installation) page on the official documentation

## Why use Conveyor CI

Conveyor CI is ideal for teams and organizations that need a flexible, embeddable CI/CD engine to power custom platforms or workflows.

It is ideal for use cases such as developing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) where organisations need to integrate CI/CD into their own developer platform with full control over pipelines and workflows, automating internal workflows that go beyond standard software pipelines, quickly prototyping new CI/CD workflows, edge self hosted or air gapped deployments etc.

To make this possible, Conveyor CI ships the following features:

- Declarative Pipelines and Workflows
- Custom Execution Logic
- Realtime Event Driven Architecture
- Lightweight Design
- API-first & SDK-ready
- Modern Distributed Architecture
